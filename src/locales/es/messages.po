msgid "But what if you were able to attach a small amount of money to your online interactions, and the person you were interacting with was, for a period of time, allowed to destroy your staked money? A stranger might now be more willing to pay attention and trust you, because you have skin in the game."

msgid "The instant trust earned by staking enables transacting with a much broader set of people. More people would accommodate a couch surfer who staked money for the duration of her stay. More people would accept a staked meeting request from a stranger. More people would host events if attendees staked their attendance. More people would pick up cold calls if they were staked."

msgid "What about using stakes to enforce promises? Imagine an app that allows a man to stake on a date. For 24 hours she has the power to indiscriminately slash the money he has put down, so she’s more likely to believe him when he promises to be a gentleman. This app can be made with Erasure."
