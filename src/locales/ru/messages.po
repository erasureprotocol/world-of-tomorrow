msgid "But what if you were able to attach a small amount of money to your online interactions, and the person you were interacting with was, for a period of time, allowed to destroy your staked money? A stranger might now be more willing to pay attention and trust you, because you have skin in the game."

msgid "The instant trust earned by staking enables transacting with a much broader set of people. More people would accommodate a couch surfer who staked money for the duration of her stay. More people would accept a staked meeting request from a stranger. More people would host events if attendees staked their attendance. More people would pick up cold calls if they were staked."

msgid "“Erasure solves the problem of bad information online. What would Reddit look like if users had something real to lose for every post, would troll farms be able to manipulate it as easily? What if you could burn a publication’s stake for promoting fake news, or an advertiser for misleading consumers? Can Erasure help manage the threat of deep-fakes? It may be that the only way to distinguish good from bad information online may come down to how much value its creator stakes behind it. That’s the vision of this protocol.”"
